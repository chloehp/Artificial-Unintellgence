So anyway I had this dream last night where I thought I was a bunch of bees, but then I was out at sea on a raft and I couldn't see any land, but I needed to find land or I wouldn't be able to make a new Queen Bee and get bee food, um, pollen? But anyway then Mary Berry was there but it made sense and then I woke up. So what do you make of that?",
